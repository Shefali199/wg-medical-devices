# H1 Discovering Linux kernel subsystems used by openAPS

Work in progress

Discovering Linux kernel subsystem in use can be accomplished using Linux kernel features and commands. The goal is to gather the system state while OpenAPS workload is running ro determine which parts of the kernel is being used.

The system state includes:

- Device drivers
- System calls
- Sub-systems

Linux kernel event tracing, ptrace, and user-space commands lsmod and strace commands will be employed to gather the system information.

Plan of action:

- Enable event tracing before starting the workload.
- Extract system call numbers from trace and map them to system calls
- Start OpenAPS application from strace
- Run lsmod to gather module information

OpenAPS employs setup scripts to launch OpenAPS applications. As a resuly using strace is not an option. We modifled
